This modpack aims to make Survival Let's Plays and SMP server experiences more enjoyable. It offers significantly more improvements and features than the [JS Basic Play](https://modrinth.com/modpack/js-basic-play) modpack.

This modpack may be restricted on some public servers due to mods like MouseTweaks or ClientSort. Use it at your own risk and stay informed about server rules.
