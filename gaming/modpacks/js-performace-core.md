This modpack aims to make Minecraft playable again on "potato" computers. It contains only the bare minimum required for performance. Because of this, you won't find mods like Iris here. If you are looking for "Quality of Life" modpacks, I don't have any yet—but they are coming soon!

## Features

* **Maximum Optimization:** Built on the latest Fabric loader with essential mods like Sodium, Lithium, and FerriteCore.
* **Smart Culling:** Aggressive culling of hidden objects and particles to save GPU resources.
* **Vanilla-Friendly:** No gameplay changes. It’s the Minecraft you know, just much faster.
* **Lean & Clean:** No Iris or shaders are included by default to keep the pack as lightweight as possible.
